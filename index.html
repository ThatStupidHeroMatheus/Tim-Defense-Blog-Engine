Well, if you want to use it, there you go.<br/>Credit is not needed, although it would be appreciated.<br/>Just don't claim you made it (unless you forked it, which is pretty easy to do<br/>because it's literally just a TurboWarp project).<br/>Well, have fun.<br/><a href="https://tim-defense-blog-engine.pages.dev/TDBE/" id="i38ai" class="gjs-link">Click here to see TDBE in action</a>.<br/>- TSHM</div></body>
