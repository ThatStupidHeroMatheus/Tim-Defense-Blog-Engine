Well, if you want to use it, there you go.<br/>Credit is not needed, although it would be appreciated.<br/>Just don't claim you made it (unless you forked it, which is pretty easy to do<br/>because it's literally just a TurboWarp project).<br/>Well, have fun.<br/>You can access some posts by typing it without having to use TDBE, can you find them?<br/>- TSHM</div></body>
